What are operators in python?
Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

For example:

>>> 2+3
5
Here, + is the operator that performs addition. 2 and 3 are the operands and 5 is the output of the operation.

Arithmetic operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

Arithmetic operators in Python
Operator	Meaning	Example
+	Add two operands or unary plus	x + y
+2
-	Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus	x - y
-2
*	Multiply two operands	x * y
/	Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)	x / y
%	Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right	x % y (remainder of x/y)
//	Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line	x // y
**	Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right	x**y (x to the power y)
Example #1: Arithmetic operators in Python
x = 15
y = 4

# Output: x + y = 19
print('x + y =',x+y)

# Output: x - y = 11
print('x - y =',x-y)

# Output: x * y = 60
print('x * y =',x*y)

# Output: x / y = 3.75
print('x / y =',x/y)

# Output: x // y = 3
print('x // y =',x//y)

# Output: x ** y = 50625
print('x ** y =',x**y)
When you run the program, the output will be:

x + y = 19
x - y = 11
x * y = 60
x / y = 3.75
x // y = 3
x ** y = 50625


#Comparison operators are used to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.

#Comparision operators in Python
#Operator	              Meaning	                      Example
>	Greater that - True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
<	Less that - True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
==	Equal to - True if both operands are equal	x == y
!=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
>=	Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y
